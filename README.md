## TODO
_ **Databse not fully setup -- need to bring in existing schema ~~

- MVP:
  - Forgot password, delete account
  - Add emails when filters change
    - Send an email with a link to the filter
- Refactor: listings should have a method to turn themselves into text representations
- Refactor: listings should have a fromSQL method
- Sort entries by newest first. Just need to store timestamp when we insert the entry
