# QUHouseFinder

All of Kingston's student listings, aggregated in one place.

## Datasources (implemented and planned)

- Frontenac âœ…
- Limetsone âœ…
- Axon âœ…
- Panadew âœ…ðŸš§
  - Only scrapes from the first page. Need to implement multi-page requests
- Heron Management âœ…
- Facebook (in progress) ðŸ“‹
- Ebay (in progress) ðŸ“‹
- Queen's Community Housing âœ…

## TODO
- Forgot password, delete account
- Add emails when filters change
  - Filter to SQL conversion
- Change: need to not delete every entry at the beginning of each update. Instead, mark entries that aren't found
          by the scraper again and wait a day or so before deleting them. If its from facebook (NYI datasource) then
          let's wait more like 10 days since its a really volatile datasource.
          - Added conflict timestamps. Now just add per datasource rules in the updater
